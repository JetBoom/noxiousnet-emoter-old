# Emoter (old)

One of the old ways noxiousnet made money was allowing players to upload custom sound files with a chat text trigger for a small fee.

This was eventually reworked due to download sizes becoming too big. It was later replaced with a system that dynamically downloaded the files from the web *during* the game, and cached them in your data folder.

This repo is the **old** sound uploading and approval system, hastily written in terrible PHP code circa 2012, way before I remade the entire noxiousnet site in Node.js

It's probably best you don't directly copy paste the code but it's there for anyone curious.
